This project I will be creating a game called 'Phrase Hunter' which will give the user a random phrase to guess, but they are only allowed
five wrong guesses. This project will utilize JavaScript classes to easily divide up tasks using constructors and class methods. I will have 
plently of practice with conditional statements in this project to calculate different outcomes of the game, including a game that is won 
and a game where you lose.
