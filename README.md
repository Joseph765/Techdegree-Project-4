This project I will be creating a game called 'Phrase Hunter' which will give the user a random phrase to guess, but they are only allowed
five wrong guesses. This project will utilize JavaScript classes to easily divide up tasks using constructors and class methods. I will have 
plently of practice with conditional statements in this project to calculate different outcomes of the game, including a game that is won 
and a game where you lose.

I added functionality in the project that allows you to type in your guesses with your keyboard by adding an event listener in app.js. I also added some styling to this project so that when the game is started, each individual key on the screen fades in with jQuery, as well as removing a bug in the game that I found where if you highlighted the hidden phrase, it would show the hidden letters behind the background of 
the blue highlighting.
